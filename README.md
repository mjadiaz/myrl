# MyRL 

Simple modular implementations of different Reinforcement Learning algorithms.

- DQN
- DDPG

The folder agent_config contains the hypeparameters for the different kind of agents. 

To do:
- [ ] Implement prioritized experience replay properly
- [ ] Random warm start for experience replay
- [ ] Distributed DDPG
